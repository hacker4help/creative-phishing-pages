# Creative-Phishing-Pages
This contains the creative phishing pages designed with the collaboaration with Bits Pilani PS-1 interns for the awareness and seminars.

We have created different branches for different areas of phishing pages.
Branches are:- 1.Instagram phishing:- which contains the bluetick verification phishing
               2.Facebook phishing:- which contains the facebook phishing page
               3.Amazon phishing:- which contains the amazon phishing along the BitB implementation in the signup page.
               4.Flipkart phishing:- same like amazon phishing just the interface will be of flipkart.
               5.Banking phishing:-Bank account credentials phishing. (IN MAIN BRANCH)

            Note:- Every branch has its own code and the main branch has bank phishing code.
            so PLEASE dont merge the branch.
